# Land-Suitability-Analysis
This project performs a GIS-based Land Suitability Analysis to identify suitable locations for new residential development. Using elevation, road, river, and land-use data, each criterion is scored (0–10), weighted, and combined through raster analysis in ArcGIS to produce a final suitability map.
